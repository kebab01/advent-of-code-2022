# Advent of code 2022

Here you will find my solutions to [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Each file contains 2 functions excluding main. `part1()` and `part2()`, which have the solutions for each part of that days advent of code challenge.

This year I will be attempting my solutions in [go](https://go.dev/) in order to get more familiar with the language and hoping to beat my 15 star personal best from last year.
